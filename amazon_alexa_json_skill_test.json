  "mainText": "Pete found himself standing upright. An unexpected change, as the last thing he remembered, was lying down in a hospital bed. A bed he had been certain he would never leave again.

Upon closer inspection, he stood on a white, somewhat fluffy, material. Even though he had no idea what it felt like to stand and walk on a cloud he thought this would be a very good approximation. He looked back up and noticed the glowing golden gate in front of him for the first time.

It was a very peculiar gate. Its sides weren't attached to anything, it just separated the space he was standing on from the space behind the gate. If Pete wanted to, he could just walk around it.

The gate opened, it's two sides sliding inward. "Eɴᴛᴇʀ ᴀɴᴅ ʏᴇ ꜱʜᴀʟʟ ʙᴇ Jᴜᴅɢᴇᴅ!" a voice boomed all around him.

It slowly dawned on Pete. "So the Catholics were right?" He thought back to the bible studies his parents had made him go to in his youth. He was in a world of trouble.

Turning around, Pete looked for a way out. There wasn't any. It was a vast expanse of white fluffy cloud as far as he could see. The only thing breaking the monotony was the gate and Pete himself.

"Hᴜʀʀʏ ᴜᴘ, ɪ ᴅᴏɴ'ᴛ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ᴀʟʟ ᴅᴀʏ."

What? Pete shrugged, stepping forward. Eternal damnation it is.

As he cleared the gate Pete saw something on the horizon. Having no better idea of where to go, Pete headed towards it. After what felt like an eternity to Pete he got close enough to make out some details. It looked like the back side of a throne.

"God?" Pete asked hesitantly. The throne started to spin. The entity on the throne and Pete couldn't define it any better than 'entity', looked like something out of a horror movie. Roughly human shaped it had wings on it's back, tentacles as beard and scales.

"Yᴇᴀʜ, ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ ᴛʜᴀᴛ," the entity on the throne said seeing the shock written in Pete's face, "I ʀᴇᴀʟʟʏ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ɴᴏ ɪᴅᴇᴀ ᴡʜᴇʀᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ʜᴜᴍᴀɴꜱ ɢᴇᴛ ᴀʟʟ ʏᴏᴜʀ ɪᴅᴇᴀꜱ ꜰʀᴏᴍ." It shrugged and put what looked like an oversized iPhone phone down. "Tʜᴏᴜɢʜ ꜱᴏᴍᴇ ᴀʀᴇ ʀᴇᴀʟʟʏ ɴᴇᴀᴛ", it said pointing to the mobile now placed on the armrest of the throne.

"Aɴʏ ǫᴜᴇꜱᴛɪᴏɴꜱ ʙᴇꜰᴏʀᴇ ᴡᴇ ʙᴇɢɪɴ Jᴜᴅɢᴇᴍᴇɴᴛ?"

"Yes, millions. What is this? Were the Catholics right? Who are you? Am I going to hell? What is the meaning of li..." the entity raised its claw-hand and Pete stopped.

"Tʜɪꜱ ɪꜱ ʏᴏᴜʀ Jᴜᴅɢᴇᴍᴇɴᴛ. Aʟʟ ʀᴇʟɪɢɪᴏɴꜱ ᴀʀᴇ ʀɪɢʜᴛ ᴀɴᴅ ᴡʀᴏɴɢ ᴀᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ꜱᴀᴍᴇ ᴛɪᴍᴇ. Tʜᴇ ᴏɴʟʏ ᴏɴᴇ ᴡʜᴏ ᴡʀᴏᴛᴇ ᴅᴏᴡɴ ᴘᴀʀᴛꜱ ᴏꜰ ᴛʜᴇ ʀᴜʟᴇꜱ ᴄᴏʀʀᴇᴄᴛʟʏ ᴡᴀꜱ ᴀ ʙʟᴏᴋᴇ ᴄᴀʟʟᴇᴅ Lᴇᴠɪᴛɪᴄᴜꜱ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴇᴠᴇɴ ʜᴇ ɢᴏᴛ ᴍᴏꜱᴛ ᴏꜰ ɪᴛ ᴡʀᴏɴɢ. Aꜱ ꜰᴏʀ ᴡʜᴏ ɪ ᴀᴍ," the entity grabbed something from behind the throne, "I ᴡᴀꜱ ᴛɪʀᴇᴅ ᴏꜰ ᴀɴꜱᴡᴇʀɪɴɢ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ǫᴜᴇꜱᴛɪᴏɴ ᴇᴀᴄʜ ᴀɴᴅ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏ ᴛɪᴍᴇ, ꜱᴏ ɪ ʜᴀᴅ ᴏɴᴇ ᴏꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡʀɪᴛᴇ ᴀ ǫᴜɪᴄᴋ ꜱᴜᴍᴍᴀʀʏ," he handed a stack of badly copied and stapled pages to Pete. The cover showing a stylized resemblance of the entity with the title "The Call of Cthulhu" written below it.

"Sᴏ, ʟᴇᴛ'ꜱ ꜱᴇᴇ ʜᴏᴡ ʏᴏᴜ ᴅɪᴅ," Cthulhu picked up the mobile, "Iᴛ'ꜱ ᴀʟʟ ɪɴ ʜᴇʀᴇ. ɴᴇᴀᴛ, ʀɪɢʜᴛ?" While Pete was wondering if that was a rhetoric question or if he was supposed to answer, Cthulhu had already started listing aspects of Pete's life.

"Aʟᴡᴀʏꜱ ᴛʀɪᴇᴅ ᴛᴏ ʙᴇ ɴɪᴄᴇ ... ɢᴏᴏᴅ,

ɢᴀᴠᴇ ᴍᴏɴᴇʏ ᴛᴏ ᴄʜᴀʀɪᴛʏ ... ɢᴏᴏᴅ,

ᴛʀɪᴇᴅ ᴛᴏ ʟᴇᴀᴅ ᴀɴ ᴇɴᴠɪʀᴏɴᴍᴇɴᴛᴀʟʟʏ ꜰʀɪᴇɴᴅʟʏ ʟɪꜰᴇ ... ɢᴏᴏᴅ," the list went on an on.

Pete tuned out, not fully understanding the way this worked. Would he sum up all 'good' and 'bad' items in the end and decide?

"Gᴀʏ" Pete cringed, he had been afraid of this one "Nᴏ ᴏɴᴇ ᴄᴀʀᴇꜱ," Cthulhu went on to the next items.

"Mɪxᴇᴅ ʟɪɴᴇɴ ᴀɴᴅ ᴡᴏᴏʟ" Cthulhu groaned. "Wʜʏ? Wʜʏ ᴅᴏ ʏᴏᴜ ʜᴜᴍᴀɴꜱ ᴀʟᴡᴀʏꜱ ᴅᴏ ᴛʜɪꜱ. Tʜɪꜱ ɪꜱ ʟɪᴋᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ᴏɴʟʏ ʀᴜʟᴇ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴍᴀᴛᴛᴇʀꜱ. Wᴇʟʟ, ᴍᴜʀᴅᴇʀ ᴛᴏᴏ, ʙᴜᴛ ᴍɪxɪɴɢ ꜰᴀʙʀɪᴄꜱ?" Cthulhu put the phone away "Sᴏʀʀʏ, ʙᴜᴛ ᴛʜɪꜱ ʀᴇᴀʟʟʏ ɪꜱ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴏᴡɴ ꜰᴀᴜʟᴛ."

He raised his arm, summoning a door, fire dancing around its edges. Pete heard screams as the door opened.",
